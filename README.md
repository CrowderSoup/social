# Social 

Social will consist of two parts, a link aggregator (Mast), and a CMS of sorts
(Boat).

## Boat 

### TODO:

- Refactor to use a config file for things (like secrets, database info, etc)
- Allow editing of user profile, then pull this data from the db and use it for
    h-cards and whatnot
    - Add "About" and "extended" about to profile
- Allow editing some things about the site, like site name 
    - Use site settings in site for title and navbar and whatnot
- Make an "About" page that's basically just an h-card with an "extended" about
    - Link to this page from a post as the "author"
